			El Metate is a psychedelic spacefunk collective from San Francisco that formed in the summer of 2013. Their recorded body of work runs the gamut from soaring, guitar-fueled originals that recall Soulive and Boogaloo Joe Jones to reinterpretations of rare groove classics awash in a psychedelic haze of Hammond Organ and Fender Rhodes.
			<br><br>
			On any given night - be it a sojourn down the coast to some of the western seaboard's most storied musical outposts, or an all night, postmodern/pre-apocalyptic space odyssey in their hometown of San Francisco - El Metate is a band possessed. 
			<br><br>
			After headlining sold-out shows to enthusiastic (if not rabid) audiences and sharing the stage with Monophonics, Tea Leaf Green, Robert Walter's 20th Congress, Con Brio, Wil Blades, and members of Lettuce, El Metate has begun to take the show on the road. With a West Coast tour under their belts and a debut album slated for early 2016, these young musical retrofuturists are ready to share their music the masses.
